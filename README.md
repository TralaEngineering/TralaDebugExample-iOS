# Edits not Reset on Cancel

Our testers have reported the following bug:

1. Tap on a cell to edit it.
1. Make a change to either name.
1. Tap “Cancel” to cancel — do *not* tap “Save”
1. Scroll the table down and then up again.
1. Note that the cancelled change is now somehow displayed in the cell?
